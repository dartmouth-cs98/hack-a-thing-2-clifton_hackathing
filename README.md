## BlockChain

# Credits
I used [this turorial](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/creating-your-first-blockchain-with-java-part-2-transactions-2cdac335e0ce) extensively in creating this project.

# Description
I built a small example of a functional cryptocurrency using a blockchain.  

# What I learned
I really had no understanding of how cryptocurrency or blockchains worked before doing this, and now I think I have a pretty good understanding, though I'm sure I still have a few holes.

# Possible project
ne of the people I am hoping to work with was discussing making a digital signature algorithm using the blockchain, so i figured I should try to get some idea of how it works.

# What didn't work
Before I had a good idea of what proof of work meant, I thought I could come up with all kinds of interesting work functions. I'm sure there are still some possibilities if I dug a bit deeper, but I didn't really have time.
